Fantasia
########

A MUD-like project, with wiki-like area creation mechanisms.

The inspiration for the name, Fantasia, came from the Neverending Story films, in which Sebastian has to recreate an entire world using his imagination.

I'm also experimenting on the following technologies:

- node
- coffeescript
- express
- mongodb
- mongoose
- redis
- socket.io
- stitch

I've also been inspired by Phloston Paradise, a procedural text adventure MMO developed by Devine Lu Linvega and Renaud Bedard. You can play it at [http://paradise.xxiivv.com/](http://paradise.xxiivv.com/).

I found this game while struggling to further understand another Devine Lu Linvega's game, Hiversaires, that I strongly recommend for anyone that likes hard puzzle games. It's available for iOS and Android, and there are additional informations in his site, [http://wiki.xxiivv.com/Hiversaires](http://wiki.xxiivv.com/Hiversaires).
