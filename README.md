A MUD-like project, with wiki-like area creation mechanisms.

The inspiration for the name, Fantasia, came from the Neverending Story films, in which Sebastian has to recreate an entire world using his imagination.

I'm also experimenting on the following technologies:

- node
- coffeescript
- express
- mongodb
- mongoose
- redis
- socket.io
- stitch
